## Comments

### HTML
Search for `prof comment` in individual files for specific comments.

- Take some time to review your html structure and consider if you can simplify your structure by removing unnecessary `div` elements. Remember, we only want to add `div` elements when a layout is not possible with the existing structure or would be made much easier with extra `div`.
